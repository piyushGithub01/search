The potato asks the girl to prove this. 
The little girl tells the potato all the things children do to have fun. 
She tells the potato that kids can play games, do cartwheels, skip, walk on their hands, have a race, and play on the swing. 
She also tells the potato that better than everything else, kids can imagine.
