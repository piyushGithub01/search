Goodnight Moon
This is a lovely picture book for children. 
It features a bunny saying goodnight to everything around it. 
The sentences form a rhyming poem and describe how the bunny says goodnight to various living and inanimate objects around it, such as a red balloon, a dollhouse, two kittens, the moon, and so on. 
It goes “Goodnight room, Goodnight moon, Goodnight cow jumping over the moon, Goodnight light, and the red balloon. 
Little children love the rhymes and the soothing rhythm of the story quickly lulls them to sleep.
