Midas and the Golden touch
The story of Midas is another classic bedtime tale for kids. 
This ancient story from Greece describes King Midas as a greedy and discontented man, who loved gold more than anything else. 
Once, he did a good deed for someone, and a Greek God appeared before him, saying that he will be granted his heart’s desire for doing the good deed. 
Midas wished that everything he touched should turn into gold, instantly. 
The God granted his wish. 
Midas was very excited and went about touching random objects, turning everything he touched into gold. 
After a while, he became hungry. 
However, when he touched his food, it turned to gold, and he could not eat it. 
He was starving and dismayed that he could not eat. Seeing him troubled, his loving daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. 
Midas was horrified that his daughter had become a statue of gold. 
He regretted asking for the Golden Touch and realised that he had been greedy and that gold was not the most precious thing in the world. 
He cried and begged the God to take back his wish. 
The God took pity on him and asked him to take a dip in the river by his palace, and then fill a pitcher of water from the river and sprinkle it on all the things he wanted to change back. 
He followed the instructions and changed his daughter back to normal. 
He was very happy to get his beloved daughter back and stopped being greedy from that moment.
